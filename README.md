# DecodeDeepNN

DecodeDeep NN is my repository of code for decoding selected layers of popular 
deep neural networks like AlexNet, VGG16/19, Inception, etc...

This will build on work done by Josiah Burnham, who has written Tensorflow/Keras
methods to push images through popular deep neural networks so that one can train
classifiers on the output of selected layers.
