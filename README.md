# DecodeDeepNN
Repository of code for decoding selected layers of popular deep neural networks
This will build heavily on work done by Josiah Burnham, who has written Tensorflow/Keras
methods to push images through popular deep neural networks so that one can train
classifiers on the output of selected layers.
